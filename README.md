## Hi there! My name is Ivan Kleshnin

## About Me

I’m a software engineer, mentor, and blogger doing web development since 2007.
Currently focused on running my own educational platform [Paqmind.com](https://paqmind.com).
Occasionally open for mentorship, consulting, and freelance opportunities. 

My professional interests are quite broad and include software architecture, functional programming, 
type systems – to name just a few. My working preferences are minimalism and 改善 (kaidzen, continuous improvement).
I also know a thing a two about web design and development.

As a mentor, I prefer to give knowledge that will remain relevant over the years. 
Some of my former students work at Yandex, Sberbank, Alfa bank, Epam, Toptal, etc.
