### Contacts

I‚Äôm occasionally open for mentorship opportunities. Drop me a PM, if you're interested in FP vs OOP, advanced TypeScript and/or web app architecture. As a mentor, I prefer to give knowledge that will remain relevant over the years. Many of my former students have been working at Yandex, Sberbank, Alfa bank, Epam, Toptal, etc.
